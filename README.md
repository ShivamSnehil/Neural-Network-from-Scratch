# 🧠 Neural Network from Scratch (Python + NumPy)

This project demonstrates the complete implementation of a **multi-layer neural network from scratch** using **Python**, **NumPy**, and **Pandas** — with **no external deep learning libraries** like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The model supports both **regression** and **classification** tasks (including **multiclass classification with softmax**).

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Fully customizable architecture: define number of layers, neurons, and activation functions
- ✅ Supports **regression**, **binary classification**, and **multiclass classification**
- ✅ Built-in support for **ReLU**, **Sigmoid**, **Linear**, and **Softmax** activations
- ✅ Implements **forward propagation**, **backpropagation**, and **gradient descent**
- ✅ Offers a choice between **SGD** and **Adam optimizer**
- ✅ Includes examples for training and testing on both regression and classification problems

## 📊 Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas to extend the capabilities of this project:

- 📈 **Mini-batch gradient descent** support
- 🧠 **Dropout** and **regularization** for improved generalization
- 🗃️ Save/load model weights using JSON or NumPy
- 📉 Interactive plots for loss/accuracy tracking
- 🔍 Integration with real-world datasets (e.g., MNIST, Iris, etc.)
